Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at Caltech within the Computation & Neural Systems option. Previously, I was a research affiliate with the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT and a senior research associate in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where I was a member of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory. My research interests involve studying altered states of consciousness, such as sleep and general anesthesia, and also how deep neural networks can be applied to the analysis of brain activity.
